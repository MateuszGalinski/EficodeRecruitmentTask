### Docker

I created a docker-compose file as well as dockerfiles for both frontend and backend. It can be run by using docker-compose up command after providing a API-key in backend app

### Cloud hosting

In case of cloud hosting i would run two separate cloud runs on GCP and expose necessary ports and communicate that way


#### Terraform

I would automate a process of creating artifact registries and then running them as cloud runs
